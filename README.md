This is a practice web application that I used to learn React with. It has a backend and a frontend so that I could learn some more than the React tutorial covers. To run it you need to run the backend and frontend separately.

## To run the backend
You need Java installed. Execute the following:
```shell
cd backend
./gradlew bootRun
```

## To run the frontend
You need Node and npm installed. Execute the following:
```shell
cd frontend
npm run start:local
```

Now you can access the webapp at http://localhost:3000 although it should open in your browser automatically.
